/* The questions in this assignment are about doing soccer analytics using SQL. 
Create the tables by importing the csv files provided: 
     england.csv, france.csv, germany.csv, italy.csv
Use DataGrip to import the files and automatically create the tables.
The data will then be in tables England, France, Germany, and Italy.
The tables contain more than 100 years of soccer game statistics.

Write SQL statements to answer the questions.

Submit this file after adding your queries.
Submit one spreadsheet file with your visualizations for questions 2, 7, 9, 10, 12
(one sheet per question named by question number, e.g. Q2, Q7, etc).  */

Find all the games in England between seasons 1920 and 1999 such that the total goals are at least 13.
Order by total goals descending.*/

/*Q3 (2 pt)
Find for each team in England in tier 1 the total number of games played since 1980.
Report only teams with at least 300 games.

Hint. Find the number of games each team has played as "home".
Find the number of games each team has played as "visitor".
Then union the two and take the sum of the number of games.

For each pair team1, team2 in England, in tier 1,

For each pair team1, team2 in England in tier 1 report the number of home-wins and away-wins
since 1980 of team1 versus team2.

Hint. Join the results of the two previous queries. To do that you can use those
queries as subqueries. Remove their ORDER BY clause when making them subqueries.
Be careful on the join conditions.

/*Q9 (3 pt)
One of the beliefs many people have about Italian soccer teams is that they play much more defense than offense.
Catenaccio or The Chain is a tactical system in football with a strong emphasis on defence.
In Italian, catenaccio means "door-bolt", which implies a highly organised and effective backline defence
focused on nullifying opponents' attacks and preventing goal-scoring opportunities.
In this question we would like to see whether the number of goals in Italy is on average smaller than in England.

Find the average total goals per season in England and Italy since the 1970 season.
The results should be (season, england_avg, italy_avg) triples, ordered by season.

Hint.
Subquery 1: Find the average total goals per season in England.
Subquery 2: Find the average total goals per season in Italy
   (there is no totgoal in table Italy. Take hgoal+vgoal).
Join the two subqueries on season.

It was in the year 1992 when we can see Italy’s avg total goals increased more than England’s.
After 1992, we can observe that the gap between Italy and England in their average total goals decreased.
